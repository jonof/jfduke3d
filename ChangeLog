 * Replaced my daft 1.3/1.4 autodetection code in gamedef.c. It was causing
   a problem with the Purify TC where the freezer ammo is set to 800, but
   because the range of an unsigned char is 0-255, and the camerashittable
   variable is a char, it was wrapping to give a max of 32. Oops. Note to
   self: never do hack solutions.


31 May 2004

 * Fixed a nasty crash when playing the Merc2 TC. The compiled size of
   the CON code was too big for the script buffer. Duke Meets Doom TC
   is still crashing though. Thanks to MMA for bringing this to my
   attention.
 * Heavens' knows what else I changed between last release and now.
   Diff is your friend.


20 May 2004

 * Peter Cordes spotted an off-by-one when displaying the month in the
   User Maps menu.


8 May 2004

 * Menus added for network game support.


16 Apr 2004

 * Thanks to a great catch by Lauri Liinat, sound crash bugs with the
   Watcom version of the jaudiolib mixers should be eliminated now.


8 Mar 2004

 * Modifications to use the new setpalettefadeclamps() function to
   eliminate unnecessary texture cache resets in GL mode.


13 Feb 2004

 * Joystick axis configuration in-game.


12 Feb 2004

 * Restored the usual meaning of ControllerType in the config file,
   and updated Setup.exe to respect it. Ideally, I'll allow all input
   devices to be enabled at once and used at will, but it'll mean I
   need to change the getinputs() function a bit. When that happens
   ControllerType will be entirely irrelevant.
 * I forgot to store the current values of the joystick parameters
   loaded from the configuration file with regards to axes and whatnot.
   Fixed now.


10 Feb 2004

 * Made the [k]?dfread functions in cache1d.c in the engine a tad
   bulletproof, and applied the armour to anything using those
   functions so the game won't crash if a corrupted savegame or demo
   is read.


8 Feb 2004

 * Joystick buttons configuration menu added. Axes and whatnot still
   to come.
 * Home and End keys in game function selection list move to head and
   tail of list.
 * Pressing a number or letter in the user map lists will jump to the
   first entry in the selected list that matches that character.
 * Savegame preview picture tile wasn't being reset in GL mode when
   selecting a game to load.


27 Jan 2004

 * Made some extra checks and fixes in the CON parser to handle files
   that have EOF with no preceeding newline.


25 Jan 2004

 * Fixed the CON parser to properly include in any level of source
   files.
 * Added CON parser modifications for high-colour tile declarations.


24 Jan 2004

 * Added in a small game stats display ala Shadow Warrior.


16 Jan 2004

 * Grower no longer selectable when playing with v1.3d data.
 * Demos from different game data groups won't play with other data
   groups. Same goes for savegames -- those from one group won't
   work with others, eg. 1.3d with Atomic.
 * Version number has been increased due to the changes above.


14 Jan 2004

 * Added in the modifications I made to Build to show maps inside
   the group files in the User maps menu.


10 Jan 2004

 * Rearranged the options menus. Things were getting unweildly so
   some fresh reshuffling keeps things in logical places now.
 * Modified the way I force the game to redraw the status bar when
   in GL mode. Instead of continuously redrawing the bar, I redraw
   it every frame ONLY IF a call to palto() was made.


1 Jan 2004

 * Many changes to palette fade handling, and whatnot.


23 Dec 2003

 * Modified some palette fades and palto() to use the engine-land
   palette fading abilities I added to the engine.
 * Polymost can do 6 degrees of freedom so when using a polymost
   renderer, screen tilting uses polymost, which is kinda necessary
   for opengl anyway.


20 Dec 2003

 * Screen tilting now uses polymost tilt abilities if a polymost
   renderer is used.
 * Some time a couple of weeks ago key setup and mouse setup menus
   were added.


6 Nov 2003

 * Modifying the options menu. Made main menu options go to a sub-
   menu for picking which options set to change. Added more options
   sets for video mode changes, key setup and mouse setup, and
   extended the game options to include another page for some
   embellishments.


20 Nov 2003

 * Voxels now integrated. To use them you need to either make a new
   CON file and include it from GAME.CON, or add lines like this to
   something like USER.CON:

	definevoxel QUEBALL PAWN.KVX
	definevoxel STRIPEBALL ROOK.KVX
	definevoxel POCKET KNIGHT.KVX
	definevoxel DESKLAMP DESKLAMP.KVX

   As you can see, the syntax is
   	definevoxel <tile number or name> <filename>


19 Nov 2003

 * Fixed a handful of things in astub.c which were affected by the
   slightly different operational details of 2D mode, plus added in
   the necessary nonsense for the additional 2D mode selection.


12 Nov 2003

 * Now compiles and runs correctly with OpenWatcom and Visual C.
 * A handful of changes sprinkled throughout, many due to differences
   highlighted by the different compilers.


14 Sep 2003

 * Made handling of "changelevel" and "map" OSD commands more elegant.
   They now act in the manner of a cheat code when issued inside a game,
   or as like a rigged menu action when not. This should make things
   more seamless and unintrusive. My previous implementation always made
   me cringe a little.
 * Added "god" and "noclip" OSD commands. Much more easy to do now that
   changing "changelevel" and "map" opened the door to the solution.


13 Sep 2003

 * Moved the "dumpbuildinfo" OSD function into the engine and out of here.
 * Fixed the crash upon loading BOBSP2.MAP by adding these lines at line
   4051 in GAME.C:

   if (sp->hitag && sp->picnum == WATERBUBBLEMAKER) {	// JBF 20030913: Pisses off move(), eg. in bobsp2
	OSD_Printf("WARNING: WATERBUBBLEMAKER %d @ %d,%d with hitag!=0. Applying fixup.\n",
			i,sp->x,sp->y);
	sp->hitag = 0;
   }

   I don't know whether there's a more elegant solution to this but unless
   other problems show the same symptoms this solution should suffice.


10 Sep 2003

 * Small type issue on GAMEDEF.C:2401 revealed by compiling with OpenWatcom.
 * Alteration for dirent.h -> direct.h for Watcom.
 * Change cast from char * to long * in RTS.C:228
 * Much screwing with audiolib to get it building with Watcom. I'm thinking
   audiolib might move into its own directory to be shared with any future
   game ports. Might happen soon.


22 Aug 2003

 * Many updates, no changelog :-/
 * Improved the user map menu.
 * Fixed a segfault bug in user map menu due to my ignorance.
 * CON version detection implemented.


21 May 2003

 * Fixed a bug in the game where the run-mode was being lost whenever a demo
   played and the game was exited while the demo was running. The saved mode
   was the same as the mode the demo was recorded with at the point of exit.
   Thanks to Ales Klobucar for pointing this out.
 * Implemented key assignment for Show_Console function in the setup program
   and the game. Unlike the other functions which can be activated by two
   keys, Show_Console is special and has only one.


15 May 2003

 * Added in-game user map selection menu based off the menu code from the
   latest version of build.exe.


11 May 2003

 * Integrated the new onscreen display facilities present in the latest Build
   engine version.


9 May 2003

 * We now have double-clicked mouse button actions, digital mouse axis support,
   and mouse axis scaling. Setup program is updated to incorporate these
   settings.
 * CONTROL_ButtonState1 |= (0xfffffffful & mask);
   What the F**K was I thinking!?!


1 May 2003

 * Fixed a crash in E4L11 where the engine thought it was supposed to render a
   certain sprite as a voxel when it really shouldn't have. See the entry in
   the bugs list below for details.


Bugs in original Duke source fixed by this port
-----------------------------------------------

During my travels over the Duke source I've uncovered and fixed a few bugs
here and there. This section is for other porters to refer to in order to save
some time.

(Line numbers refer to the original 3D Realms source distribution)

GAME.C l4851:
	In E4L11 there is a CRACK1 sprite which is floor-aligned. The game
	normally forces all crack sprites to be wall-aligned by OR'ing the
	wall-sprite bit (bit 4) into the sprite's cflags property. Problem is
	the game doesn't clear the floor-align bit (bit 5) when it does this
	so when the game is compiled with a voxel-enhanced version of the
	engine, drawsprite() thinks the sprite is to be drawn as a voxel
	because bits 4 and 5 are set simultaneously. This replacement line
	allows crack sprites to align to both the floor and the wall, but not
	have both flags set at once:

		sp->cstat |= (sp->cstat & 48) ? 1 : 17;
