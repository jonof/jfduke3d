This is a work-in-progress release of my port of Duke Nukem 3D using my
ported Build engine codebase. There are bugs which I'm tracking down and
fixing as an ongoing process.

Warnings
--------
 1. Since this is work-in-progress I cannot and will not attest to the safety
    of using this executable. You use it at your own risk!
 2. 3D Realms and Apogee do not support this port. Contact me at
    jf@jonof.id.au if you find problems.
